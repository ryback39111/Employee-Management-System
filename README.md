# Employee-Management-System

A menu-driven application called an employee management system written in C++ enables us to add, amend, delete, and search records of employees an organisation employs. The program's employee management system keeps records of each employee's name, title, department, and salary. It starts with no data. As a result, we must include personnel records in this program by selecting the proper settings.
